## Design Overview

The current design consists of an inner layer and an outer layer, all made out of 100% cotton fabric. The mask has two levels of facial adjustment and three bands to allow for a snug fitting.

### Inner Layer

An adjustable inner layer helps with the mask’s fitting to the shape of the face. The layer provides a tighter fit  in conjunction with the outer layer. This layer has a pair of elastic bands made from 100% cotton. In addition, this layer acts as housing to hold an additional filter.

### Outer Layer

The main filtering is done through the outer layer. The outer layer helps  to further close the gaps left by the first layer and also stabilizes the inner layer.The outer layer has two embedded elastic bands that enable tighter fitting.
