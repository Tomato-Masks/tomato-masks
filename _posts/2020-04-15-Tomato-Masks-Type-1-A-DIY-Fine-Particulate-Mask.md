## Design Overview

The current design consists of an inner layer and an outer layer, all made out of 100% cotton fabric. The mask has two levels of facial adjustment and three bands to allow for a snug fitting.

### Inner Layer

An adjustable inner layer helps with the mask’s fitting to the shape of the face. The layer provides a tighter fit  in conjunction with the outer layer. This layer has a pair of elastic bands made from 100% cotton. In addition, this layer acts as housing to hold an additional filter.

### Outer Layer

The main filtering is done through the outer layer. The outer layer helps  to further close the gaps left by the first layer and also stabilizes the inner layer.The outer layer has two embedded elastic bands that enable tighter fitting.

## Fabrication Instructions

### Overview

The building instructions are broken down into:

1. Preparation:

    1. Size Selection

    2. Materials

    3. Tools

    4. Layout

    5. Fitting mechanisms 

2. Inner layer fabrication

3. Outer layer fabrication

4. Total Assembly

5. Filter Installation

### Preparation

#### Size Selection

There are designs for 3 separate sizes of Small, Medium and Large. To identify the closest fit, refer to [Appendix 1](#bookmark=id.uoh3stp4by0c). 

If you have a printer, you can download and print the provided stencils from [Appendix 3](#bookmark=id.99s8jhnb54wy). Otherwise, you can refer to the design diagrams from [Appendix 2](#bookmark=id.nf6fiv5jk2ju).

#### Materials

1. 100% Cotton Fabric

    * Use an old (or new) 100% cotton clothing such as a shirt, t-shirt or button shirt:

        1. 2x rectangles (29.7 cm x 21.0 cm: A4 size paper)

        2. 2x strips (30 cm x 1 cm) (see Preparation section)

        3. 2x strips (60 cm x 1 cm) (see Preparation section)

2. Aluminum foil: A4 paper size (29.7 cm x 21.0 cm)

3. Paper clips or alternatives such:

    * wires

    * christmas ornament hangers (make sure to wrap it in aluminum foil)

    * aluminum can: cut strips (make sure to cover the edges)

    * folder fastener

    * twist ties

4. Additional filter material such as:

    * Paper towel

    * Microfiber (better alternative than paper towel)

    * PM0.3 HEPA filter (Ideal but rare)

    * Surgical mask

5. **Optional:** 

    * Knit elastic bands (2x 30 cm long strips + 2 x 60 cm long strips)

    * Shoe laces (2x 30 cm long strips + 2 x 60 cm long strips)

#### Tools

1. Sewing needle and strand (**Optional:** If sewing machine is available, then use sewing machine)

2. Ruler (Only If you cannot print the stencils from [Appendix 3](#bookmark=id.99s8jhnb54wy))

3. Scissors

#### Fitting Mechanism

<p align="center">
    ![_config.yml]({{site.baseurl}}/images/type1v04/preparation-noseclamp.jpg){: width="450px"}
</p>
<p style="max-width:600px; word-wrap:break-word; margin:0 auto">
1. Expand a large paper clip as shown above and wrap it in aluminum foil. Alternatively, use a piece of wire about 10-15 cm long.
</P>
<p align="center">
    ![_config.yml]({{site.baseurl}}/images/type1v04/aluminum-foil.jpg){: width="450px"}
</p>
<p style="max-width:600px; word-wrap:break-word; margin:0 auto">
2. Roll a letter size paper (~ 27 cm x 21.0 cm) aluminum foil along its length. The end result should be 0.8 cm - 1.0 cm thick and 21.0 cm long. This will be embedded into the fabric of the mask’s inner layer to assist with facial fitting.
</p>
<p align="center">
    ![_config.yml]({{site.baseurl}}/images/type1v04/fabric-stripe-preparation.jpg){: width="450px"}
</p>
<p style="max-width:600px; word-wrap:break-word; margin:0 auto">
3. Cut a 60 cm x 6 cm rectangle from a 100% cotton fabric. Fold it along its length  so that you end up with a 10 cm x 6 cm square. Use a ruler to draw parallel lines across its length with 1 cm gaps. These lines will be used as a guide for cutting. Once cuttings are done, you will end up with uniform strips each 60 cm length and 1 cm thick. Cut one or two of them in half to have one or two pairs of 30 cm x 1 cm strips. <strong>(Alternatively, if you have knit elastic bands, use them)</strong>
</p>

## Inner Layer

In this segment, there are **two options**:

1. Use a provided stencil under [Appendix 2](#bookmark=id.99s8jhnb54wy), as a guide to cut the fabric **(requires a printer).**

2. Use layouts from [Appendix 1](#bookmark=id.nf6fiv5jk2ju) and draw the layout onto fabric manually and then use it as a guide to cut.

### Outer Layer

In this segment, there are **two options**:

1. Use a provided stencil under [Appendix 2](#bookmark=id.99s8jhnb54wy), as a guide to cut the fabric **(requires a printer). **If you are using this option, **skip to step 9.**

2. Use layouts from [Appendix 1](#bookmark=id.nf6fiv5jk2ju) and draw the layout onto fabric manually and then use it as a guide to cut. In this case, **proceed from step 1.**

<table align="center" style="text-align:left; width: 900">

            <br>
            1. Draw the desired pattern from Appendix 1.2 onto a paper (e.g. letter size). You should have an outer hexagon pattern and an inner hexagon pattern with a gap of 2-2.5 cm.

            9. Place the two 60 cm x 1 cm 100% cotton strips on the upper and bottom edges of the hexagon. We are going to fold over the outer edges (flaps) along the inner hexagon and sew them onto the fabric. This will create a “tunnel” for the strips to pass through freely.

### Layer Integration

It is time to integrate the two layers:

<table align="center" style="text-align:left; width: 900">
    <tr>
        <td style="width:400px">
            <img class="tbl"  src="/images/type1v04/v04-13.jpg">
            <br>
            1. Cut out two, 1 cm wide holes, on both left and right sides of the outer shell, midway between top and bottom strips.
        </td>
        <td style="width:400px">
            <img class="tbl"  src="/images/type1v04/v04-14.jpg">
            <br>
            2. Pass through the two strips from the inner shell on both left and right openings. Please note that the embedded folded aluminum piece should face up and should line up with the paper clip nose clamp of the outer shell.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="2">
            3. The final result should look like this:

            <img src="/images/type1v04/fullmask.jpg" width="450px">
            </p>
            <br>
            In the next step, the secondary filter will be inserted.
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Disposable Filter Insertion

Use any of the followings materials:
<ul>
    <li>Paper towel </li>
    <li>Microfiber (better alternative than paper towel) </li>
    <li>PM0.3 HEPA filter (Ideal but rare) </li>
    <li>Surgical mask </li>
</ul>

Fold them or cut them if necessary so that they can fit inside the inner layer. Use the inner layer’s rims as a means to stabilize the inserted filter. In the example below, a paper towel was folded in half first and the corners were folded again to better match the inner layer’s silhouette:
